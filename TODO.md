### validity checks (done?)
- need to make sure the previous character(s) are valid when cicking an operation key
    - e.g., you can't have just "/12", there needs to be smth like "36/12"
- only one decimal: use .contains(".")?

### visuals
- input inside div
    - center?
    - fill parent?
- looping text
    - horizontal scrollbar
    - stays on right side when adding text (might be like this by default, idrk)
- equation display
    - add or input or whatever to left side of screen
